SkimLit: NLP for Scientific Literature Classification
Overview
This project implements SkimLit, an NLP-based approach to automatically classify and label sections of scientific abstracts. Using deep learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP), the model is trained to predict the different parts of a research paper (e.g., objectives, methods, results) from raw text. The SkimLit model helps speed up the process of reviewing scientific literature by skimming through abstracts and summarizing key information.

In this project, we will:

Utilize pre-trained language models (e.g., BERT, BioBERT, or DistilBERT) for feature extraction.
Fine-tune these models on a custom scientific literature dataset to classify various parts of research papers.
Evaluate the performance of the model using precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.
Key Features
NLP-based classification of scientific literature sections.
Fine-tuning of pre-trained language models on domain-specific datasets.
Use of Tokenizers for text preprocessing.
Text vectorization and sequence padding for efficient model training.
Model evaluation using common NLP metrics: Precision, Recall, and F1-score.
Requirements
To run this project, you'll need the following dependencies:

Python 3.x
TensorFlow 2.x
Transformers (Hugging Face)
Tokenizers
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
scikit-learn (for evaluation metrics)

For this project, we used a dataset of scientific abstracts, specifically structured to contain labeled sections of abstracts (e.g., "background," "objective," "methods," "results"). You can either use a publicly available dataset or create a custom one for training the model.

Data Preprocessing
The text data is tokenized using Hugging Faceâ€™s Transformers Tokenizer. The tokenizer splits the abstracts into word tokens, and sequences are padded or truncated to ensure consistent input size.
Pre-trained Models
In this project, you can choose between various pre-trained language models, such as:

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
BioBERT (specifically trained on biomedical text)
DistilBERT (a smaller, faster version of BERT)
The code is designed to easily switch between these models by changing the model configuration.

Fine-Tuning Strategy
We freeze the base transformer model's layers initially and train only the top classifier layers. After that, we unfreeze the deeper layers of the model and perform fine-tuning to adapt the model better to the target domain (scientific abstracts).

Results
Upon completion, the project will output:

Precision, recall, and F1-score for each section label.
Confusion matrix to visualize model performance across different classes.
Text classification predictions on a sample set of scientific abstracts.
Visualizations
The project will generate:

Accuracy and loss curves for training and validation phases.
Confusion matrix to evaluate how well the model performs across different sections of scientific literature.
